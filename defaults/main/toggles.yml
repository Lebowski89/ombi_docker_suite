################################
# DEPENDENCIES
################################

  ## Toggle whether to install required apt packages during role run
  ## apt packages include: python3-requests, python3-pymysql, python3-lxml

ombi_toggles_enable_apt_packages: true 

################################
# DOCKER
################################

  ## Toggle whether to install docker during role run
  ## Will add dockers gpg key / repository
  ## apt dependency packages include: ca-certificates, curl
  ## apt docker packages include: docker-ce, docker-ce-cli, containerd.io, docker-buildx-plugin, docker-compose-plugin

ombi_toggles_enable_docker_install: true

################################
# MARIADB
################################

  ## Toggle whether to use Mariadb as a database for ombi
  ## If enabled, the role will create Ombi's database.json with the required Postgres settings
  ## The role will then ping for an existing Postgres docker container and then create one if none exists
  ## This role can create an Ombi postgres database during the Mariadb container deployment
  ## Note: Unlike my roles that use Postgres, this role will not create an Ombi database on existing Mariadb installs

ombi_toggles_enable_mariadb: true

  ## warning: the below toggles will delete any existing sqlite database files in the ombi appdir.

ombi_toggles_clean_files: true  # true will delete any existing sqlite database files in the ombi appdir.

################################
# TRAEFIK
################################

  ## Toggle whether to reverse-proxy ombi behind Traefik (This role doesn't include setting up Traefik)
  ## Includes joining ombi to the Traefik docker network (or creating one if it doesn't exist)
  ## Includes defining ombi's Traefik http/https/http-api/https-api router labels
  ## In this role, the cert-resolver is cloudflare (named: dns-cloudflare) with tls options defined in Traefik's config file (tls-opts@file)
  ## Various middleware includes: globalHeaders@file,redirect-to-https@docker,robotHeaders@file,secureHeaders@file
  ## What middleware you use will be up to your needs and how you've set them up and named them within Traefik
  ## Additional middleware for Authelia, Cloudflare, Theme-park will be defined based on toggles/conditionals (see the toggle section for each)

ombi_toggles_enable_traefik: true

################################
# CLOUDFLARE
################################

  ## Toggle whether to use the Ansible 'community.general.cloudflare_dns' module to add a DNS record for ombi and Prometheus (if using metrics)
  ## By default, this role will add a proxied 'A' record for each, with the use of a cloudflare token (Zone:Read, DNS:Edit)
  ## It is also possible to use your global api + user email if you desire - this will require changes to the 'community.general.cloudflare_dns' tasks
  ## See the module documentation on what is required. Personally, I prefer using a dedicated token for Traefik rather than handing over my global API
  ## This role will remove and add your desired DNS on each run, just in case you've changed your desired sub-domain name, DNS type, or proxy settings

ombi_toggles_enable_cloudflare_dns: true

  ## Toggle whether to include the cloudflarewarp middleware to ombi's Traefik labels
  ## Requires setting up and defining the cloudflarewarp plugin in Traefik - this role won't do that for you
  ## See the plugin documentation for what it is and what it can do - https://github.com/BetterCorp/cloudflarewarp
  ## If enabled, the middleware will be combined with the others you've defined in the defaults variables (See the vars/ombi.yml and vars/prometheus.yml files)

ombi_toggles_enable_cloudflarewarp: true
